# Development Process
After finding the walkability index dataset, we outlined what the problem was and brainstormed some ideas we wanted to have on our visualization. We wanted to showcase how walkability is impacted on different variables such as intersection density, transit availability, employment, housing density, etc. When someone thinks of what makes a city walkable, these factors may not be obvious. We decided to visualize each of these variables on a national scale and see if there are any trends between them and walkability. We also found data specific to DC, and we wanted to visualize any additional relationships between walkability and other factors in a smaller scale. Another idea for visualization was to include a street view, where the users could see examples of what a walkable area would look like in person. 

We planned the structure of our visualization and organized who would be working on what shortly after our proposal. We wanted to emphasize the story aspect and guide the user into learning about walkability. A meeting with Fumeng Yang gave us insight on better visualization techniques and how we should allow more interactivity. 

# Division of Work
We divided work by splitting into pairs and working on seperate visualizations. Candace and Calvin worked on the Tableau visualization of DC while Nicole and Riva worked on the d3 visualizations of the United States. Candace also worked on the street view as well as additional formatting for the page. Calvin worked on the write-up. 

#Acknowledgements
We used data from the United State Enviromental Protection Agency. Specifically their walkability index found here: https://catalog.data.gov/dataset/walkability-index8/resource/356986ec-b9ab-4fdf-8838-7262a08502e3 
We also used various datasets from the District of Columbia's publicly available data. These datasets are found below:
