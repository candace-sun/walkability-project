    <h2>Intro</h2> </br>
    <div class="intro">
        <h3>Walkability is just what it sounds: a "walkable" place is easy to walk around.</h3>
        <p>[Explanation and more intro text here]</p>
        <p>The main variables that contribute to ‚Äúwalkability‚Äù of a census block group (CBG) are intersection
            density, proximity to transit stops, diversity of land uses, employment mix, and employment and
            household
            mix. </br>
            These four variables are quantified based on the CBG's score for each variable. For simplicity and
            interactivity, we
            aggregated the CBGs by county. Multiple CBGs belong in each county, so we averaged the corresponding
            values.


            <br />
            <br />
            <span class="walk-var density">Intersection density:</span> Higher intersection density is correlated
            with
            more walk trips
            <br />
            <span class="walk-var proximity">Proximity to transit stops:</span>The distance in meters from the
            population center to the nearest
            transit
            stop.
            Transit stops greater than ¬æ miles away were assigned a value of -99999 and not included. Shorter
            distances
            correlate with more walk trips.
            <br />
            <span class="walk-var e-mix">Employment mix:</span> The mix of employment types in a block group (such
            as
            retail, office, or
            industrial). Higher
            values correlate with more walk trips
            <br />
            <span class="walk-var eh-mix">Employment and household mix:</span> The mix of employment types and
            occupied
            housing. A block group
            with a diverse
            set of employment types (such as office, retail, and service) plus many occupied housing units will have
            a
            relatively high value. Higher values correlate with more walk trips.

        <h2>The Walkability Formula</h2> </br>

        <p>
            The ranked scores were then weighted by the following formula:

            <img src="walk-formula.PNG" alt="Walkability Formula">
            Where:
            <br />
            w = block group‚Äôs ranked score for intersection density
            <br />
            x = block group‚Äôs ranked score for proximity to transit stops
            <br />
            y = block group‚Äôs ranked score for employment mix
            <br />
            z = block group‚Äôs ranked score for employment and household mix
            <br /><br />
            The <b>National Walkability Index</b> is assigned for each CBG between 1 and 20, with least walkable
            (1.0-5.75),
            below
            average
            walkable (5.76-10.5), above average walkable
            (10.51-15.25) and most walkable (15.26-20.0).

        <h2>Let's Dive into DC!</h2></br>
        <p>Now that you know what walkability is, let's go a little deeper. The Distric of Columbia provides access
            to
            hundreds of
            datasets found <a href="https://catalog.data.gov/organization/district-of-columbia">here.</a> We
            composed a
            visualization
            using multiple datasets to show how complex walkability can be. Before we get started, we have to
            introduce
            some variables first.</p> </br>

        <p><strong>Pedestrian Friendliness Index (PFI):</strong> DC scores each Census block showing how walkable
            they
            are, relative to other Census
            blocks. An area deemed ‚Äòmost walkable‚Äô has a connected street grid with sidewalks, buildings set close
            to
            the street, and intersections
            and blocks that are manageable for pedestrians. It is essentially the same as walkability</br>
            <strong>Block Density:</strong> Calculated by dividing total blocks by the total area of each
            neighborhood.
            A neighborhood that is more
            dense means that there are more buildings and people in the neighborhood. </br>
            <strong>Average Metrobus Ridership:</strong> DC scores every quarter mile in grid format by average
            daily
            metrobus ridership. Areas
            with high average ridership are indicative of the jobs, population and activity generators within and
            near
            those grid cells.</br>
            <strong>Attractions Accessible via Walk:</strong> This measures how many destinations in a neighborhood
            are
            accessible by at least 20
            minutes of walking. </br>
            <strong>Four Way Intersection Score:</strong> This measures how many four way intersections there are
            compared to dead ends and other intersections.</br>
        </p>
        <br />

        Now, let's take a look at these variables within DC! You can toggle between the different variables and also
        view the metro stations in the area as reference points.

    <h2>Conclusion</h2><br />
    <p>
        Overall, you can see how walkability is a complex topic that is affected by many different factors. We have
        visualized the
        walkability of the US and DC using multiple datasets. The National Walkability Index is a good starting
        point to
        understand how walkable an area is, but it is important to consider other factors such as pedestrian
        friendliness,
        block density, and metro ridership, as we examined in DC. We hope that this project has helped you
        understand
        the importance of
        walkability and how it can be improved in your own neighborhood!
